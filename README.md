## Module 6 

## Description 
This is a simple website where you enter your desired city and it displays the current weather conditions with icons as well as a 5 day forecast. Once a city has been searched it will be saved to local storage and saved for future use. 

## Usage 
Please enter your desired city into the search bar. Once searched it will display the current weather conditions, as well as a 5 day forecast. Your city searches will be saved and displayed as buttons to re-search. 

## Tests 
Please enter as many cities as you'd like at different times because with the free openweather API you can only get up to 40 pulls within 3 hour intervals.
